# churn

Churn analysis is the evaluation of a companyâ€™s customer loss rate in order to reduce it. It is one of the most important and challenging problems for businesses such as credit card and telecommunication companies. The full cost of churn includes both lost revenue and the marketing costs involved with replacing those customers with new ones. Statistics show that acquiring new customers can cost five times more than retaining existing customers.

# project

In this project, the data set churn.csv is being analyzed. The data set is from a credit card company, where it is possible to review customer attributes such as gender, age, tenure, balance, number of products they are subscribed to, their estimated salary and if they left the company or not. In this analysis tree methods will be used to predict, which customer groups have the highest risk of churn.

# methods

There are four models built in this project, using decision trees, random forests, bagging and gradient boosting, and the best is chosen to make the prediction.
